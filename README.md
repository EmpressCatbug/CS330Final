# CS 330 Final Project: 3D Scene and Design Decisions

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for my CS 330 Final Project. This project showcases my work in computational graphics and visualization, featuring a fully realized 3D scene of my personal desk setup and an accompanying design decisions document. This project demonstrates my proficiency in 3D modeling, texturing, lighting, and camera control, all essential skills in the field of computer graphics.

- **CS330_Final_Project_Design_Decisions.docx**: The document detailing the design decisions, navigation setup, and custom functions used in the project.

## Project Description

### 3D Scene

The 3D scene replicates my personal desk setup, including a lavender corner desk, three monitors, and a keyboard. The scene highlights various aspects of 3D modeling and rendering:
- **Modeling**: The desk, monitors, and keyboard were modeled using basic shapes such as boxes and cylinders, with careful attention to proportions and positioning.
- **Texturing**: Realistic textures were applied to each object to enhance visual detail, including a lavender texture for the desk and screen textures for the monitors.
- **Lighting**: Multiple light sources, including ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting, were implemented to create realistic lighting effects and shadows.

### Navigation and Interaction

The virtual camera in the 3D scene allows for intuitive navigation using keyboard and mouse inputs:
- **Movement**: Use W, A, S, D keys for forward, left, backward, and right movement, respectively.
- **Orientation**: The mouse cursor changes the camera's orientation to look up, down, right, and left.
- **Speed Adjustment**: The mouse scroll adjusts the camera's movement speed.
- **Perspective Switch**: Press the 'P' key for perspective view and the 'O' key for orthographic view, allowing users to switch between 3D and 2D representations.


### Design Decisions Document

The design decisions document provides a comprehensive explanation of the development process, including:
- **Selection of Objects**: Rationale for choosing specific objects and their relevance.
- **Use of Basic Shapes**: Description of how basic shapes were used to model the scene.
- **Texturing and Lighting**: Techniques used for applying textures and lighting to enhance realism.
- **Custom Functions**: Details on custom functions created to maintain modularity and reusability in the code.

### How do I approach designing software?

#### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

Working on this project has refined my skills in 3D modeling and shader programming, allowing me to create detailed and realistic scenes. I have also developed a deeper understanding of modular design, which is crucial for maintaining clean and reusable code.

#### What design process did you follow for your project work?

I followed an iterative design process, starting with a basic layout and gradually adding details such as textures and lighting. This approach allowed me to continuously test and refine the scene, ensuring a high level of detail and accuracy.

#### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The iterative design process and focus on modularity can be applied to future projects to ensure quality and maintainability. Breaking down complex tasks and continuously testing and refining work are essential strategies for successful software development.

### How do I approach developing programs?

#### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I utilized new strategies such as implementing perspective and orthographic views using the `glViewport` and `glOrtho` functions. Custom functions for transformations and shader settings were also developed to maintain code modularity.

#### How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was key to the development process. By continuously testing and refining each component of the scene, I was able to identify and fix issues early, leading to a polished final product.

#### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

My approach evolved to emphasize modularity and reusability. Through feedback and continuous improvement, I learned to create reusable functions, reducing redundancy and enhancing code maintainability.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

#### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Computational graphics and visualizations have provided me with skills to create interactive and visually appealing applications, valuable for future coursework involving graphical interfaces, game development, and data visualization.

#### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

These skills open up opportunities in industries such as gaming, animation, virtual reality, and simulation. The ability to create and manipulate 3D graphics is highly sought after, enhancing my career prospects in these fields.
